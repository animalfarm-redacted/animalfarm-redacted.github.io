            About<br><br>
            This version of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm" target="_blank">Animal Farm</a></i> is a digital remediation of the classical novel by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell" target="_blank">George Orwell</a>. 
            In this new form of the book, the text itself is tightly bound to the story and the events of the narration.
            One of the main themes of Animal Farm is how, in any society, the control of information and the manipulation of truth are some of the fundamental elements 
            to allow the exercise of any authoritarian power.</p>
            <p>To highlight and enhance this concept, the text changes and transforms as the reader keeps reading. Previous pages are continuously censored,
            redacted and modified to ensure that they are always consistent with the truth being told at that particular moment in time.
            In this way, the appearance of the book imitates the farm animalâ€™s memory, which is never static and is constantly being modified and adjusted by the pigs.</p>
            <p>Through the text, the reader will find links that will allow him to go back to previous chapters and check what is changed. 
              A selection of black and white photos from the 1920s and 1930s (the years in which the novel is supposed to be set) have been added, to make full use of the possibilities of the digital medium and to further immerse the reader into the story.</p>
